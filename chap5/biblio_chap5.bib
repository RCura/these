  abstract = {Since the mid-1990s a plethora of indicator projects have been developed and adopted by cities seeking to measure and monitor various aspects of urban systems. These have been accompanied by city benchmarking endeavours that seek to compare intra- and inter-urban performance. More recently, the data underpinning such projects have started to become more open to citizens, more real-time in nature generated through sensors and locative/social media, and displayed via interactive visualisations and dashboards that can be accessed via the internet. In this paper, we examine such initiatives arguing that they advance a narrowly conceived but powerful realist epistemology – the city as visualised facts – that is reshaping how managers and citizens come to know and govern cities. We set out how and to what ends indicator, benchmarking and dashboard initiatives are being employed by cities. We argue that whilst these initiatives often seek to make urban processes and performance more transparent and to improve decision making, they are also underpinned by a naive instrumental rationality, are open to manipulation by vested interests, and suffer from often unacknowledged methodological and technical issues. Drawing on our own experience of working on indicator and dashboard projects, we argue for a conceptual re-imaging of such projects as data assemblages – complex, politically-infused, socio-technical systems that, rather than reflecting cities, actively frame and produce them.},

  abstract = {Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. Information Dashboard Design will explain how to:Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard designProvide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearlyApply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of informationMinimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusionOrganize business information to support meaning and usabilityCreate an aesthetically pleasing viewing experienceMaintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretationOptimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectivenessStephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator.

  abstract = {This work presents a survey of the current state of the art of visualization techniques for parallel coordinates. It covers geometric models for constructing parallel coordinates and reviews methods for creating and understanding visual representations of parallel coordinates. The classification of these methods is based on a taxonomy that was established from the literature and is aimed at guiding researchers to find existing techniques and identifying white spots that require further research. The techniques covered in this survey are further related to an established taxonomy of knowledge-discovery tasks to support users of parallel coordinates in choosing a technique for their problem at hand. Finally, we discuss the challenges in constructing and understanding parallel-coordinates plots and provide some examples from different application domains.},
