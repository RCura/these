  abstract = {Confusion about model validation is one of the main challenges in using ecological models for decision support, such as the regulation of pesticides. Decision makers need to know whether a model is a sufficiently good representation of its real counterpart and what criteria can be used to answer this question. Unclear terminology is one of the main obstacles to a good understanding of what model validation is, how it works, and what it can deliver. Therefore, we performed a literature review and derived a standard set of terms. ‘Validation’ was identified as a catch-all term, which is thus useless for any practical purpose. We introduce the term ‘evaludation’, a fusion of ‘evaluation’ and ‘validation’, to describe the entire process of assessing a model's quality and reliability. Considering the iterative nature of model development, the modelling cycle, we identified six essential elements of evaludation: (i) ‘data evaluation’ for scrutinising the quality of numerical and qualitative data used for model development and testing; (ii) ‘conceptual model evaluation’ for examining the simplifying assumptions underlying a model's design; (iii) ‘implementation verification’ for testing the model's implementation in equations and as a computer programme; (iv) ‘model output verification’ for comparing model output to data and patterns that guided model design and were possibly used for calibration; (v) ‘model analysis’ for exploring the model's sensitivity to changes in parameters and process formulations to make sure that the mechanistic basis of main behaviours of the model has been well understood; and (vi) ‘model output corroboration’ for comparing model output to new data and patterns that were not used for model development and parameterisation. Currently, most decision makers require ‘validating’ a model by testing its predictions with new experiments or data. Despite being desirable, this is neither sufficient nor necessary for a model to be useful for decision support. We believe that the proposed set of terms and its relation to the modelling cycle can help to make quality assessments and reality checks of ecological models more comprehensive and transparent.},

A major problem concerns the spatial definition and required number of zones in such models, and an elementary theoretical analysis of this zoning problem is attempted. The effect of space on the model is investigated in terms of the problem of measuring locational attraction, and the effect of aggregating a zoning system on model performance is assessed using a model of the Northampton region. Calibration of such models is discussed in terms of response surfaces, and a fast calibration technique known as the Newton-Raphson method is introduced. Finally, various concepts and techniques involving the use of dummy zones in resolving the regional definition problem are outlined.},

We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model’s predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.},

In this article, they are used as statistical benchmarks for comparing the shapes of urban hierarchies and evolutionary trends of seven systems of cities in the world including BRICS, Europe, and United States. In order to provide conclusions that avoid the pitfalls of too small samples or uncontrolled urban definitions, these models are tested on some 20,000 urban units whose geographically significant delineations were harmonized in each country over 50 years between 1960 and 2010. As a result, if the models appear not always statistically valid, their usefulness is confirmed since the observed deviations from empirical data remain limited and can often be interpreted from the geohistorical context of urbanism proper to each world region. Moreover, the article provides new free software which authorizes the reproducibility of our experiments with our data bases as well as with complementary data.},

Unlike most previous applications of agent-based modelling in political science, we adopt a descriptively complex rather than a simple model of behaviour. Experimenting with different levels of mobilisation allows estimation of the extent to which mobilisation spreads beyond the primary mobilisation target across the population as well as whether or not it survives over time. We argue that in a complex world cascade effects are smaller than previously thought. However, mobilisation effects can create secondary effects through habitual voting and increases in political interest and party affiliation, which reverberate over time, creating long-term spillover effects.},

Using evolutionary game theory, we provide existence conditions for a potential function, which characterizes the global configuration of the city and is maximized in the stationary state. We use this potential function to analyze the outcome of the model for three utility functions corresponding to different degrees of preference for mixed neighborhoods: (i) we show that linear utility functions is the only case where the potential function is proportional to collective utility, the latter being therefore maximized in stationary configurations; (ii) Schelling's original utility function is shown to drive segregation at the expense of collective utility; (iii) if agents have a strict preference for mixed neighborhoods but also prefer to be in the majority versus the minority, the model converges to perfectly segregated configurations, which clearly diverge from the social optimum. Departing from the existing literature, these conclusions are based on analytical results which open the way to analysis of many preference structures. Since our model is based on bounded rather than continuous neighborhoods as in Schelling's original model, we discuss the differences generated by the bounded- and continuous-neighborhood definitions and show that, in the case of the continuous neighborhood, a potential function exists if and only if the utility functions are linear. A side result is that our analysis builds a bridge between Schelling's model and the Duncan and Duncan segregation index.},

  abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels—especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour—is essential for making the science predictive. ‘Pattern-oriented modelling’ (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

Such models are limited in their ability to model individual behaviour and geographical influences. Heppenstall et al presented a novel agent-based framework for modelling individual petrol stations as agents and integrated important additional system behaviour through the use of established methodologies such as spatial interaction models. The parameters for this model were initially determined by the use of real data analysis and experimentation. This paper explores the parameterisation and verification of the model through data analysis and by use of a genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that a GA can be used to produce not just an optimised match, but results that match those derived by expert analysis through rational exploration. This may suggest that despite the apparent nonlinear and complex nature of the system, there are a limited number of optimal or near optimal behaviours given its constraints, and that both user-driven and GA solutions converge on them.},

The former ensures rigour, the latter relevance. We discuss a method that combines these two approaches, beginning with a complex model and then modelling the complicated model with simpler models. The resulting “chain” of models ensures some rigour and relevance. We illustrate this process on a complex model of voting intentions, constructing a reduced model which agrees well with the predictions of the full model. Experiments with variations of the simpler model yield additional insights which are hidden by the complexity of the full model. This approach facilitated collaboration between social scientists and physicists—the complex model was specified based on the social science literature, and the simpler model constrained to agree (in core aspects) with the complicated model.},

We have paid particular attention to the writings of economists who have been concerned with testing the validity of economic models. Among the questions which we shall consider are included: What does it mean to verify a computer model of an industrial system? Are there any differences between the verification of computer models and the verification of other types of models? If so, what are some of these differences? Also considered are a number of measures and techniques for testing the "goodness of fit" of time series generated by computer models to observed historical series.},

Suggested background

    The function machine

The function machine is a handy metaphor that illustrates how functions work. A function f
takes an input, say represented by the variable x, and spits out the value f(x)

.
Function machine

The function machine metaphor can also aid one in understanding how a function can depend on parameters. Parmameters are additional quantities that influence the behavior of the function. However, unlike the input variables, parameters are typically viewed as being held constant, or possibly changing slowly.

The influence of parameters on a function is the like influence of dials on a machine. For a given setting of the dials, the machine processes the inputs in a certain way. If one leaves the dials fixed, then the function machine always spits out the same output value for a given fixed input value.

If one wishes to change how the machine is operating, one can adjust one of the dials, i.e., change one of the parameters. When the dials are changed, the machine still process the inputs and turns them into outputs. However, with new parameters, for the same fixed input value, the function machine may now spit out a different output value than it did before the parameters were changed.
Function machine parameters

For example, we could define a quadratic function f
with three parameters a, b, and c as
f(x)=ax2+bx+c.
For a given set of parameters, such as a=b=c=1, the function f behaves like a normal function. Since with these parameters, f(x)=x2+x+1, whenever we put x=2 in the function machine, it always produces f(2)=22+2+1=7

.

When we change the parameters, we turn f
into a different function. For example, if we change a into a=2, now f operates using the formula f(x)=2x2+x+1, and f(2)=2⋅22+2+1=11

. In this sense, a function with parameters represents a whole family of functions, one for each value of the parameters.

If we don't know specific values for the parameter, we can still use the function machine to operate on input values. If we leave the parameters a
, b, and c as their symbols, then f(2)=4a+2b+c. Then, once we know numerical values for the parameters, we can immediately determine a numeric value for f(2)

.
Parameters, input variables: what's the difference?

For the function f(x)=ax2+bx+c
, could we learn something by leaving the expression in terms of the symbols a, b, and c and seeing how f(x) depends on the parameters? Maybe we could fix x=2 and look how f(2) changes as we let a

vary.

If we do such manipulations and look at how the output of a function depends on varying a parameter, then we are treating the function as though the parameter were a input variable. But that's OK, as the difference between variables and parameters is really just a matter of perspective.

The output of the function machine will depend both on the setting of the dial and the object we put in the input funnel. The behavior of the function machine would not change if we replaced one of the dials with another input funnel and specified the former dial's setting by putting an object representing that setting into the new input funnel. In this sense, inputs and parameters are equivalent.

The distinction between inputs and parameters is merely a matter of convenience. If we know that a setting is going to stay fixed for awhile, it is more convenient to represent it with a dial that doesn't change its value until we manually change it. Then, it is natural to explore the behavior of the function machine with many inputs before changing a parameter value.},

A parameter is a quantity that influences the output or behavior of a mathematical object but is viewed as being held constant. Parameters are closely related to variables, and the difference is sometimes just a matter of perspective. Variables are viewed as changing while parameters typically either don't change or change more slowly. In some contexts, one can imagine performing multiple experiments, where the variables are changing through each experiment, but the parameters are held fixed during each experiment and only change between experiments.

One place parameters appear is within functions. For example, a function might a generic quadratic function as
f(x)=ax2+bx+c.

Here, the variable x is regarded as the input to the function. The symbols a, b, and c are parameters that determine the behavior of the function f. For each value of the parameters, we get a different function. The influence of parameters on a function is captureed by the metaphor of dials on a function machine.},

  abstract = {This monograph presents urban simulation methods that help in better understanding urban dynamics. Over historical times, cities have progressively absorbed a larger part of human population and will concentrate three quarters of humankind before the end of the century. This “urban transition” that has totally transformed the way we inhabit the planet is globally understood in its socio-economic rationales but is less frequently questioned as a spatio-temporal process. However, the cities, because they are intrinsically linked in a game of competition for resources and development, self organize in “systems of cities” where their future becomes more and more interdependent. The high frequency and intensity of interactions between cities explain that urban systems all over the world exhibit large similarities in their hierarchical and functional structure and rather regular dynamics. They are complex systems whose emergence, structure and further evolution are widely governed by the multiple kinds of interaction that link the various actors and institutions investing in cities their efforts, capital, knowledge and intelligence. Simulation models that reconstruct this dynamics may help in better understanding it and exploring future plausible evolutions of urban systems. This would provide better insight about how societies can manage the ecological transition at local, regional and global scales. The author has developed a series of instruments that greatly improve the techniques of validation for such models of social sciences that can be submitted to many applications in a variety of geographical situations. Examples are given for several BRICS countries, Europe and United States. The target audience primarily comprises research experts in the field of urban dynamics, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students.},

  abstract = {Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who do not possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That is why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex-system model in the field of geography.},

  abstract = {L'évolution des villes est-elle le résultat de leurs multiples interactions ? C'est sur ce postulat que s'appuie la théorie évolutive urbaine (Pumain, 2000) pour analyser les processus de croissance des villes. Cette thèse, réalisée dans un contexte inter-disciplinaire, vise à évaluer la validité d'une telle hypothèse par la simulation informatique. Pour mener à bien ce projet, les savoirs accumulés sur la dynamique des systèmes de villes sont d'abord rassemblés afin d'en extraire les grandes caractéristiques, synthétisées sous la forme de dix fait stylisés majeurs. Deux modèles de simulation, SimpopLocal et SimpopNet, sont ensuite construits, documentés de manière standardisée, et explorés de manière systématique. Ces modèles interrogent chacun un aspect précis de la théorie évolutive urbaine: la nature des interactions interurbaines pour le premier et leur support pour le second. Les besoins associés à leur nécessaire évaluation ont guidé la conception et la mise en œuvre de deux protocoles d'explorations systématiques inédits: une méthode de calibrage automatisée, et un protocole d'analyse de sensibilité qui évalue individuellement la contribution de chaque mécanisme aux comportements simulés. Ces deux formes d'exploration confrontent de façon systématique les résultats de simulation avec les connaissances actuelles. Elles montrent que ces modèles sont capables de rendre compte de processus clés de la dynamique des systèmes des villes et prouvent pour la première fois la nécessité de mécanismes d'interactions interurbaines pour simuler des croissances proches des évolutions de systèmes réels.},

  abstract = {Context
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder for which a number of genetic, environmental, and nutritional causes have been proposed. Glyphosate is used widely as a crop desiccant and as an herbicide in fields of genetically modified foods that are glyphosate resistant. Several researchers have proposed that it may be a cause of autism, based on epidemiological data that correlates increased usage of glyphosate with an increased autism rate.

Objective
The current study was intended to determine if excessive glyphosate was present in the triplets and their parents and to evaluate biochemical findings for the family to determine the potential effects of its presence.

Design
The author performed a case study with the cooperation of the parents and the attending physician.

Setting
The study took place at The Great Plains Laboratory, Inc (Lenexa, KS, USA).

Participants
Participants were triplets, 2 male children and 1 female, and their parents. The 2 male children had autism, whereas the female had a possible seizure disorder. All 3 had elevated urinary glyphosate, and all of the triplets and their mother had elevated values of succinic acid or tiglylglycine, which are indicators of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Intervention
The participants received a diet of organic food only.

Outcome Measures
The study performed organic acids, glyphosate, toxic chemicals and tiglylglycine, and creatinine testing of the participants’ urine.

Results
The 2 male triplets with autism had abnormalities on at least 1 organic acids test, including elevated phenolic compounds such as 4-cresol, 3-[3-hydroxyphenyl]-3-hydroxypropionic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, which have been previously associated with Clostridia bacteria and autism. The female, who was suspected of having a seizure disorder but not autism, did not have elevated phenolic compounds but did have a significantly elevated value of the metabolite tiglylglycine, a marker for mitochondrial dysfunction and/or mutations. One male triplet was retested postintervention and was found to have a markedly lower amount of glyphosate in his urine.

Conclusions
The pattern of metabolites in the urine samples of the males with autism are consistent with a recent theory of autism that connects widespread glyphosate use with alteration of animal and human gastrointestinal flora. That theory is that the normally beneficial bacteria species that are sensitive to glyphosate are diminished and harmful bacteria species, such as Clostridia, that are insensitive to glyphosate, are increased following exposure to glyphosate. Excessive dopamine, caused by inhibition of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase by Clostridia metabolites, in turn, produces oxidative species that damage neuronal Krebs cycle enzymes, neuronal mitochondria, and neuronal structural elements such as the neurofibrils.},

  abstract = {In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are called arguments. An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call can be assigned to the corresponding parameters.
Just as in standard mathematical usage, the argument is thus the actual input passed to a function, procedure, or routine, whereas the parameter is the variable inside the implementation of the subroutine. For example, if one defines the add subroutine as def add(x, y): return x + y, then x, y are parameters, while if this is called as add(2, 3), then 2, 3 are the arguments. Note that variables from the calling context can be arguments: if the subroutine is called as a = 2; b = 3; add(a, b) then the variables a, b are the arguments, not only the values 2, 3. See the Parameters and arguments section for more information.
In the most common case, call by value, a parameter acts within the subroutine as a variable initialized to the value of the argument (a local (isolated) copy of the argument if the argument is a variable), but in other cases, e.g. call by reference, the argument supplied by the caller can be affected by actions within the called subroutine (as discussed in evaluation strategy). In call by value, one can thus think of arguments as values (properly, think of the value of arguments as the "arguments" themselves), but in general arguments are not simply values.
The semantics for how parameters can be declared and how the arguments are passed to the parameters of subroutines are defined by the language, but the details of how this is represented in any particular computer system depend on the calling conventions of that system.},

It shows that although every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, complete segregation is observed almost all of the time. A concept of tipping is rigorously defined, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of segregation. Complete segregation emerges and persists in the checkerboard model precisely because tipping is less likely to occur to such residential patterns. Agent-based simulations are used to illustrate how an integrated residential area is tipped into complete segregation and why this process is irreversible. This model incorporates insights from Schelling's two classical models of segregation (the checkerboard model and the neighborhood tipping model) and puts them on a rigorous footing. It helps us better understand the persistence of residential segregation in urban America.},
