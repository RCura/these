  abstract = {L'\'evolution des villes est-elle le r\'esultat de leurs multiples interactions ? C'est sur ce postulat que s'appuie la th\'eorie \'evolutive urbaine (Pumain, 2000) pour analyser les processus de croissance des villes. Cette th\`ese, r\'ealis\'ee dans un contexte inter-disciplinaire, vise \`a \'evaluer la validit\'e d'une telle hypoth\`ese par la simulation informatique. Pour mener \`a bien ce projet, les savoirs accumul\'es sur la dynamique des syst\`emes de villes sont d'abord rassembl\'es afin d'en extraire les grandes caract\'eristiques, synth\'etis\'ees sous la forme de dix fait stylis\'es majeurs. Deux mod\`eles de simulation, SimpopLocal et SimpopNet, sont ensuite construits, document\'es de mani\`ere standardis\'ee, et explor\'es de mani\`ere syst\'ematique. Ces mod\`eles interrogent chacun un aspect pr\'ecis de la th\'eorie \'evolutive urbaine: la nature des interactions interurbaines pour le premier et leur support pour le second. Les besoins associ\'es \`a leur n\'ecessaire \'evaluation ont guid\'e la conception et la mise en \oe{}uvre de deux protocoles d'explorations syst\'ematiques in\'edits: une m\'ethode de calibrage automatis\'ee, et un protocole d'analyse de sensibilit\'e qui \'evalue individuellement la contribution de chaque m\'ecanisme aux comportements simul\'es. Ces deux formes d'exploration confrontent de fa{\c c}on syst\'ematique les r\'esultats de simulation avec les connaissances actuelles. Elles montrent que ces mod\`eles sont capables de rendre compte de processus cl\'es de la dynamique des syst\`emes des villes et prouvent pour la premi\`ere fois la n\'ecessit\'e de m\'ecanismes d'interactions interurbaines pour simuler des croissances proches des \'evolutions de syst\`emes r\'eels.},

The purpose of this paper is to consider the problem of validating computer models in the light of contemporary thought in the fields of philosophy of science, economic theory, and statistics. In order to achieve this goal we have attempted to gather together and present some of the ideas of scientific philosophers, economists, statisticians, and practitioners in the field of simulation which are relevant to the problem of verifying simulation models. We have paid particular attention to the writings of economists who have been concerned with testing the validity of economic models. Among the questions which we shall consider are included: What does it mean to verify a computer model of an industrial system? Are there any differences between the verification of computer models and the verification of other types of models? If so, what are some of these differences? Also considered are a number of measures and techniques for testing the "goodness of fit" of time series generated by computer models to observed historical series.},

  abstract = {Confusion about model validation is one of the main challenges in using ecological models for decision support, such as the regulation of pesticides. Decision makers need to know whether a model is a sufficiently good representation of its real counterpart and what criteria can be used to answer this question. Unclear terminology is one of the main obstacles to a good understanding of what model validation is, how it works, and what it can deliver. Therefore, we performed a literature review and derived a standard set of terms. `Validation' was identified as a catch-all term, which is thus useless for any practical purpose. We introduce the term `evaludation', a fusion of `evaluation' and `validation', to describe the entire process of assessing a model's quality and reliability. Considering the iterative nature of model development, the modelling cycle, we identified six essential elements of evaludation: (i) `data evaluation' for scrutinising the quality of numerical and qualitative data used for model development and testing; (ii) `conceptual model evaluation' for examining the simplifying assumptions underlying a model's design; (iii) `implementation verification' for testing the model's implementation in equations and as a computer programme; (iv) `model output verification' for comparing model output to data and patterns that guided model design and were possibly used for calibration; (v) `model analysis' for exploring the model's sensitivity to changes in parameters and process formulations to make sure that the mechanistic basis of main behaviours of the model has been well understood; and (vi) `model output corroboration' for comparing model output to new data and patterns that were not used for model development and parameterisation. Currently, most decision makers require `validating' a model by testing its predictions with new experiments or data. Despite being desirable, this is neither sufficient nor necessary for a model to be useful for decision support. We believe that the proposed set of terms and its relation to the modelling cycle can help to make quality assessments and reality checks of ecological models more comprehensive and transparent.},

  abstract = {Famous examples such as Anscombe's Quartet highlight that one of the core benefits of visualizations is allowing people to discover visual patterns that might otherwise be hidden by summary statistics. This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.},

It shows that although every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, complete segregation is observed almost all of the time. A concept of tipping is rigorously defined, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of segregation. Complete segregation emerges and persists in the checkerboard model precisely because tipping is less likely to occur to such residential patterns. Agent-based simulations are used to illustrate how an integrated residential area is tipped into complete segregation and why this process is irreversible. This model incorporates insights from Schelling's two classical models of segregation (the checkerboard model and the neighborhood tipping model) and puts them on a rigorous footing. It helps us better understand the persistence of residential segregation in urban America.},

  abstract = {We propose an analytical solution to a Schelling segregation model for a relatively broad range of utility functions. Using evolutionary game theory, we provide existence conditions for a potential function, which characterizes the global configuration of the city and is maximized in the stationary state. We use this potential function to analyze the outcome of the model for three utility functions corresponding to different degrees of preference for mixed neighborhoods: (i) we show that linear utility functions is the only case where the potential function is proportional to collective utility, the latter being therefore maximized in stationary configurations; (ii) Schelling's original utility function is shown to drive segregation at the expense of collective utility; (iii) if agents have a strict preference for mixed neighborhoods but also prefer to be in the majority versus the minority, the model converges to perfectly segregated configurations, which clearly diverge from the social optimum. Departing from the existing literature, these conclusions are based on analytical results which open the way to analysis of many preference structures. Since our model is based on bounded rather than continuous neighborhoods as in Schelling's original model, we discuss the differences generated by the bounded- and continuous-neighborhood definitions and show that, in the case of the continuous neighborhood, a potential function exists if and only if the utility functions are linear. A side result is that our analysis builds a bridge between Schelling's model and the Duncan and Duncan segregation index.},

Model validation is commonly done by verifying that the model is able to reproduce the patterns to be explained. We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model's predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.},

  abstract = {Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who do not possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That is why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex-system model in the field of geography.},

In the paper, we first review and explore the relevant work from the research areas of data management, visual analytics and human computer interaction. Then for different types of data such as multimedia data, textual data, trajectory data, and graph data, we summarize the common methods for improving data quality by leveraging data cleansing techniques at different analysis stages. Based on a thorough analysis, we propose a general visual analytics framework for interactively cleansing data. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are analyzed and discussed in the context of data and humans.},
